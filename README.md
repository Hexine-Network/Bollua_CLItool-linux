# CLItool

CLItool is a multipurpose, menu-driven tool that allows you to easily install and run various projects from GitHub, including personal productivity tools and pentesting tools. It is designed for personal use and educational purposes.

**Important Note:** I am not responsible for any misuse of the program made by other users. If you screw up, you're on your own.

CLItool is inspired by other projects like Babymux, but it runs the programs it installs by itself, without the need for the user to manually run them.

CLItool is currently made for PowerShell, but I may create a bash version in the future.

I am open to any push requests, issues, or feedback you may have about this project. Please be respectful and constructive in your feedback.

If you have any tool suggestions, I'd be glad to read them out!!

# Installation
To install CLItool, clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ToaBollua/Bollua_CLItool.git`

Then, open the main.py file with Python. The menu will display the tools available for this program, and it should install them automatically.
